## Environment Variables Setup

For production deployment, make sure to set these environment variables:

```
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_NAME=your-database-name
DB_USER=your-database-user
DB_PASS=your-secure-password
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Database Migration

For production, you may need to:
1. Export your local database: `mysqldump -u root php_website > database.sql`
2. Import to production database
3. Update connection settings in `.env`

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Use strong passwords for production
- Set `APP_DEBUG=false` in production
- Use HTTPS in production
